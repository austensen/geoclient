#'
#' @section Geoclient Description:
#'
#'   The Geoclient API is a RESTful web service interface to the NYC Department
#'   of City Planningâ€™s Geosupport system developed by the Department of
#'   Information Technology and Telecommunications GIS/Mapping unit. Geosupport
#'   is a mainframe-based geocoding system used by NYC government. Geosupport
#'   provides coordinate and geographic attributes for supported input locations
#'   (address, intersection, blockface). Geoclient exposes the most widely used
#'   Geosupport functions through simple and easy to use REST representations.
#'
#' @section Geoclient Service Usage Guidelines:
#'
#'   The Geoclient API is a free geocoding service offered by the City of New
#'   York for use by the general public. Access to the service requires
#'   registering for a free account on this website and requesting an access
#'   key. Due to rapidly increasing usage of Geoclient, we are seeing a
#'   commensurate decline in overall application availability based our current
#'   contractual resource allowance from third party platform services. While we
#'   work towards increasing this capacity, we are forced to set service usage
#'   guidelines.
#'
#'   From this point forward, the following service usage guidelines apply:
#'
#'   * Maximum of 2,500 requests per minute; * Maximum of 500,000 requests per
#'   day.
#'
#'   Note that these are guidelines and not hard limits. However, if we see
#'   applications continually exceeding these limits, we will attempt to notify
#'   the account administrator based on contact information provided in the
#'   sign-up forms. If corrective action is not taken, we will then set whatever
#'   limits we deem necessary to provide equal resources averaged by all active
#'   accounts. Moving forward, as we increase capacity, we may adjust the usage
#'   guidelines.
#'
#'   By default all functions in this package adhere to these rate limiting
#'   guidelines. However, this restrictions can be overridden by setting
#'   `rate_limit` to `FALSE`.

#'   For more details see the Geoclient Documentation's guide to [calling the
#'   API](https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc#section-1.0),
#'   interpreting the [Geosupport return
#'   codes](https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc#section-2.2), and a
#'   [complete data
#'   dictionary](https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc#section-4.0) for
#'   all possible data elements returned by any geoclient function.
