#' Retrieve Geoclient Response for Addresses as a Dataframe
#'
#' This function takes components of addresses and returns the Geoclient
#' response as a tibble. The house number, street name, and one of either
#' borough or Zip code are required. The address components can be provided
#' either in separate vectors as named arguments or with a dataframe and column
#' names containing each component. If your address data is not easily separted
#' into these components you can use [`geo_search()`] with the full address as a
#' string. The Geoclient API's app ID and key can either be provided directly as
#' arguments, or you can first use [`geoclient_api_keys()`] to add them to your
#' `.Renviron` file so they can be called securely without being stored in your
#' code.
#'
#' @param .data Dataframe containing columns to be used for other arguments.
#' @param house_number The house number of the address, as either a vector of
#'   numbers (numeric or character is accepted), or a bare column name of the
#'   number field if a dataframe is provided.
#' @param street The street name of the address, as either a vector of names, or
#'   a bare column name of the number field if a dataframe is provided.
#' @param borough The name of the borough of the address, as either a vector or
#'   a bare column name of the borough field if a dataframe is provided. The
#'   borough is only required if Zip code is not provided.
#' @param zip The Zip code of the address, as either a vector (numeric or
#'   character is accepted) or a bare column name of the borough field if a
#'   dataframe is provided. The Zip code is only required if borough is not
#'   provided.
#' @param id The API app ID provided to you from the NYC Developer Portal
#'   formated in quotes. Defaults to `NULL` and your key is accessed from your
#'   `.Renviron`.
#' @param key The API app key provided to you from the NYC Developer Portal
#'   formated in quotes. Defaults to `NULL` and your key is accessed from your
#'   `.Renviron`.
#' @param rate_limit Whether you would like to limit the rate of API requests in
#'   adherence to Geoclient's Service Usage Guidelines. See `?geoclient` for
#'   more information.
#'
#' @details For more details see the Geoclient Documentation's guide to [making
#'   address
#'   requests](https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc#section-1.2.1),
#'   interpreting the [Geosupport return
#'   codes](https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc#section-2.2), the
#'   [data returned by
#'   `geo_address`](https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc#section-3.1),
#'   and a [complete data
#'   dictionary](https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc#section-4.0) for
#'   all possible data elements returned by any geoclient function.
